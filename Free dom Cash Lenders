Many of the problems that borrowers report violate the best practices of the Online Lenders Alliance, the trade association and self-policing organization for these lenders.1 Although the overall findings indicate widespread problems, abusive practices are not universal. Some large online lenders are the subject of very few complaints and are urging a crackdown on companies that mistreat customers. Aggressive and illegal actions are concentrated among the approximately 70 percent of lenders that are not licensed by all the states where they lend and among fraudulent debt collectors.2

Some states have pursued action against online lenders for making loans to residents without obtaining state licenses or for other conduct that violates state laws. But state-level enforcement is often difficult, because the lenders may be incorporated in other states or offshore, or they may claim immunity based on an affiliation with Native American tribes. Intervention by federal regulators, including the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau and the Federal Trade Commission, has helped address some of the most serious concerns.3 But this intervention has not been sufficient to solve the problems that online borrowers experience. Only through strong, clear federal guidelines for the small-dollar lending market as a whole—ensuring that all loans are based on borrowers’ ability to repay and safeguarding their checking accounts—can these illegal practices be eliminated.
